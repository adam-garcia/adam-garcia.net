My name’s Adam Garcia. My training and work have primarily been in public health research, with a focus on biostatistics and epidemiology, but I also dabble in data science and web development. I’m currently looking for work&mdash;ideally applying my [skillset and background](/resume/) at an organization similarly invested in those passions. I'm passionate about public health equity and social justice, and I'm eager to find ways we can thoughtfully collect data and leverage their insights to achieve a more healthy, just, and equal society. 


I'm from the [Ozarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Missouri) originally but have spent the better part of the last decade in the northeast, now living in Brooklyn.

If you’d like to get in touch, I'd love to chat: you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-garcia-76877ab0/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adam__garcia), or you can drop an e-mail to [hi@adam-garcia.net](mailto:hi@adam-garcia.net).
