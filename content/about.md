My name’s Adam Garcia. I'm currently working as a data analyst in New York.

My training and work have primarily been in public health research, with a focus on biostatistics and epidemiology. I also dabble in data science and web development. I'm deeply passionate about health equity and social justice and I strive to tell meaningful stories through data.

If you’d like to get in touch, I'd love to chat: you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-garcia-76877ab0/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adam__garcia), or you can drop an e-mail to [hi@adam-garcia.net](mailto:hi@adam-garcia.net).
