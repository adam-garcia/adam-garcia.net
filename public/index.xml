      <description>My name’s Adam Garcia. My training and work have primarily been in public health research, with a focus on biostatistics and epidemiology, but I also dabble in data science and web development. I’m currently looking for work&amp;mdash;ideally applying my skillset and background at an organization similarly invested in those passions. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about public health equity and social justice, and I&amp;rsquo;m eager to find ways we can thoughtfully collect data and leverage their insights to achieve a more healthy, just, and equal society.</description>
